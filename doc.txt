Some random text I found interesting on the interwebs, hope you find it amusing. 

Reference

Verizon is raising one of their charges from 70 cents to 85 cents per month. It's some dinky charge, but use it to your advantage and get out now! Anytime they raise their fees you have 60 days to opt out. It's in the Customer Agreement (You can view it on their website. Just click on the "Customer Agreement" link on the bottom of the page. It's in the paragraph called "Our Rights to Make Changes" about a third of the way down)



Just call them, tell them that you heard they are raising the Monthly Administrative Charge from .70 to .85 and you would like to opt out as the Customer Agreement agreement lets you do.

It may take time, but be persistent. Just tell them you would like to cancel and that you have the right to.

Go for it. It worked for me. It took 52 minutes, but it was well worth the time.

I am also porting out to sprint. To do this you have to leave the account open. Just tell the supervisor that you want it open, but that he should note the account that when the port goes through the ETF should be waived.

He gave me his phone number and name in case any issues come up and the ETF does get charged

I quoted the relevant terms so you can reference them:

Taxes, Surcharges and Fees

Tolls, taxes, surcharges and other fees, such as E911 and gross receipt charges, vary by market and as of January 1, 2008, add between 4% and 35% to your monthly bill and are in addition to your monthly access fees and airtime charges.
Monthly Federal Universal Service Charge on interstate & international telecom charges (varies quarterly based on FCC rate) is 11.3% per line.
The Verizon Wireless monthly Regulatory Charge is 7¢ per line.
Monthly Administrative Charge (subject to change) is 70¢ per line. Beginning May 1, 2008, the monthly Verizon Wireless Administrative Charge for voice and email plans will increase from $0.70 to $0.85 per line.
The Federal Universal Service, Regulatory and Administrative Charges are Verizon Wireless charges, not taxes. For more details on these charges, call 1–888–684–1888.

Other Suggestions:

After reviewing my April bill, I noticed the following:
Notice of Administrative Charge Increase
Beginning May 1, 2008, the monthly Verizon Wireless Administrative Charge for voice and email plans will increase from $0.70 to $0.85 per
line. For information regarding this charge, call 1.888.684.1888. Please consult your Customer Agreement for information about rate changes.I called *611, hit option 4 and then option 2.

Spoke with a very pleasant tier-0 "customer supportress". As I told her my intentions of terminating she launched into a series of apologetic offerings of upgraded service.

I remained polite and courteous and firmly cited the Notice of Administrative Charge Increase. At this point she got very quiet. I pushed on and quoted the following excerpt from the Verizon Wireless Customer Agreement:
Our Rights to Make Changes
Your service is subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures, which
we can change without notice. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BYLAW, WE CAN ALSO CHANGE PRICES AND ANY OTHER CONDITIONS IN THIS
AGREEMENT AT ANYTIME BY SENDING YOU WRITTEN NOTICE PRIOR TO THE BILLING PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGES WOULD GO INTO
EFFECT. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE YOUR SERVICE AFTER THAT POINT,YOU’RE ACCEPTING THE CHANGES. IF THE CHANGES HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOU, HOWEVER, YOU CAN END THE AFFECTED SERVICE, WITHOUT ANY EARLY TERMINATION FEE, JUST BY
CALLING US WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER WE SEND NOTICE OF THE CHANGE.With that said, she tried to regain the upper-hand by offering to disconnect my service immediately. I insisted that they wave the ETF prior to disconnect due to the "Material Adverse Effect the Administrative Charge Increase was having on me". That resulted in an 8 minute hold time while a supervisor was summoned.

The supervisor came on the line already briefed on the situation. He referred to it as the "Material Adverse Clause" [That's right kids, they're well aware of the loophole...] After a few halfhearted attempts to dissuade me from my coarse of action he approved the removal of the ETF and transferred me back to my original tier-0 supportress.

The tier-0 rep handled the grunt work and prepared the account for disconnect. At this point, I mentioned my desire to port the phone numbers to another carrier. She told me I could not do that if the account was disconnected. I mentioned a 30-day required hold time on the number to allow the port. She acknowledged this required time frame and placed my account on "port watch" status. As soon as the port request comes through, the account is automatically disconnected.

I then inquired into a prorated refund for unused minutes. Turns out I'm getting money back!

I graciously thanked my support rep and hung up after documenting her name, the name of the supervisor and their direct extensions.

Total time: 29 min & 14 sec!

I browsed over to AT&T's website and signed up for service.


Here are some pointers to increase your odds of success:

Be Courteous!
I never once raised my voice.
I didn't threaten anyone.
I made jokes and lightly flirted with the women I spoke with.
Do Your Homework!
In April of 2007, Verizon increased the Administrative Charges from $0.40 to $0.70.
They've also steadily increased the text messaging fees.
I also found a Verizon FAQ describing the Administrative Charges Taxes & Surcharges
Be Prepared!
I had a copy of the Customer Agreement pulled up and the "Material Adverse" clause highlighted.
I had copies of all relevant bills in front of me with the "Notification of Charge Increases" highlighted.
I've spent the past few days scouring the internet for success stories. Forums are full of folks who breezed through the process. I took what I needed to build my case and got everything ready before calling.

Another thing that helped my defense what that I've had chronic, well documented signal quality issues. I've spent weeks trading calls and voicemails with technical support engineers. I've had my phone replaced 3 times and the problem has never been resolved. I'm not sure bringing this up last night helped me waive the ETF because they tried transferring me to technical support. I had to firmly (but courteously) reiterate my intentions of terminating service.
